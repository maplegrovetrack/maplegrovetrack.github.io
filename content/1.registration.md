We will run things the same as we did last year. 
Here is the run down.

## Grades 9-12
- Registration will open on 2/1/24 at 8 AM.
- Boys and girls team will reach capacity at 125 registration spots each.
- Practice begins 3/11/24.

## Grades 7-8
- Registration will open on 3/11/24 at 8 AM.
- Practice begins  3/18/24.
- Boys and girls team will reach capacity at 25 registration spots each.
- We wish we could accept more athletes, but 50 middle schoolers is the capacity of our facility and coaching staff

## All Grades
- There will be a wait list for those who do not register before the capacity is reached.
- You must have a physical on file with the activities office to register. Do not email them and ask if you have one on file. When you register, it will alert you if you do not.
